[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1aa8b65a9e584fa7a2a939b5004e1521)](https://app.codacy.com/app/jdvivar/ama-weather?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=jdvivar/ama-weather&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

## Requirements
- Supply a Flickr API key as explained in [.env.example](.env.example)

## Recommended
- I recommend you to use Vue UI (part of the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org)) so that you can run all commands, serve or build the app, execute the tests, etc. by just pointing and clicking. Just do:
```
# Install local packages
npm install
# Install Vue CLI
npm install --global @vue/cli
# after successful installation
vue ui
```
and voil√†, that's all. Using the UI you don't need to know/use the commands shown below.

## Commands
#### Project setup
```
npm install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

#### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

#### Run your end-to-end tests
```
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

## Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
